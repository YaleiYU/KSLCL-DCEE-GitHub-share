# Code repository for paper "k-Step Lookahead Active Concurrent Learning-Based Dual Control of Exploration and Exploitation for Auto-Optimization"


## Overview
This repository contains MATLAB code for the implementation of the KSLCL-DCEE (k-Step Lookahead Active Concurrent Learning-based Dual Control of Exploration and Exploitation) algorithm. The code is designed to perform numerical simulations and photovoltaic simulations based on the KSLCL-DCEE framework.


## Features
- Numerical simulations 
  - Functions
  - Plot_results
  - Four main scripts for different case studies
- Photovoltaic simulations
  - Simulink model
  - Main script for photovoltaic simulations
  - Plot results for photovoltaic simulations (due to size limit, data files are not included for this scenario, please contact the author for the data files)


## Requirements
- MATLAB R2023b
- Required toolboxes :
  - Simulink
  - Simscape
  - Simscape Electrical
  - Signal processing Toolbox 

  
## Usage
```run the scripts in MATLAB to perform the simulations```

## Results  
- Numerical simulation results can be generated by running the scripts in the Numerical simulations folder.
